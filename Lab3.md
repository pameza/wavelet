#Lab 3

## Part 1
For the portion that I wrote, I used the methods `getPath` and `equals` to check if the url gives the instruction to add text. I also used `split` to separate 
what comes after the equals sign. This seems to only work for `strings`.

## Part 2
Failure inducing code:
```
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
Input and output:

We can observe that by running 3 tests, one of them failed when we expected 3 but it returned 0 instead. This is because one of the nnumbers was duplicated instead of reversed 
which yields a symptom. An empty array `{ }` and an array with only one input also passed `{1}`, however `{3,0,3}` did not.

The problem was that the numbers that were being stored were being stored in the wrong array and the wrong array was being returned.

## Part 3
In the last 2 weeks, I learned how to start using localhost as well as modifying it to run different programs. I installed Github Desktop as well as JUnit, running it for the first time.
I learned how to commit and push programs in GitHub Desktop as well as other simpler things such as forking repositories. I learned the difference between symptoms and bugs as well as a few new commands.
